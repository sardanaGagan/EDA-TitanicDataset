# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Power BI

## Overview

This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Power BI. EDA is a critical step in understanding and visualizing the dataset's characteristics, patterns, and insights before applying machine learning models or making data-driven decisions.

In this EDA project, we'll explore various aspects of the Titanic dataset, such as passenger demographics, survival rates, ticket classes, and more. The analysis is performed using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool.

## Project Contents

This project includes the following components:

1. **Power BI Report:** The main EDA is conducted within a Power BI report, which provides interactive data visualization and exploration capabilities.

2. **Data Source:** The Titanic dataset used in this project is typically available in CSV format and can be found on various data science platforms or websites.

## EDA Highlights

Here are some of the key aspects covered in this EDA:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

- **Demographics:** Exploration of passenger demographics, including age, gender, and class distribution.

- **Survival Analysis:** Visualization of survival rates among different passenger groups.

- **Ticket Class:** Examination of ticket class distribution and its impact on survival.

- **Data Insights:** Extraction of meaningful insights from the dataset to understand factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Creation of interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards to facilitate exploration.

## How to Use

To explore the Titanic dataset EDA report:

1. Install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), if not already installed.

2. Download the Titanic dataset (CSV format).

3. Open the Power BI Desktop application.

4. Open the provided Power BI report file.

5. Interact with the visualizations and explore the dataset to gain insights.
